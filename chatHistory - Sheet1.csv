heyy i did not say that
isnt it 23.1
? is it?
yeah..
bruh what-
oh u meant the velocity?
ok then just sub in 23.1 wherever i use 23
LMAO k
OH
I GET IT
so basically u get the time it takes to go 15m horizontally
yeah
and then u find how high it goes in that time
and bc horizontal velocity is always the x component of Vi
u can get arctan
and thats the angle
yeah
which step were u stuck at-
yeah and u get the vertical velocity at p from that
i think i was getting it slowly?
"but dk if i wouldve gotten the ""find dy"" part"

mhmmhm
wait shit
u hv to use v^2=u^2-2as?
yeah- u learned that right?

yes yes
ohh cuz u need velocity
mhm
