heyy i did not say that
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 8:51 PM
isnt it 23.1
Lilllll — Today at 8:51 PM
? is it?
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 8:51 PM
yeah..
Lilllll — Today at 8:51 PM
bruh what-
oh u meant the velocity?
ok then just sub in 23.1 wherever i use 23
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 8:52 PM
LMAO k
OH
I GET IT
so basically u get the time it takes to go 15m horizontally
Lilllll — Today at 8:53 PM
yeah
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 8:53 PM
and then u find how high it goes in that time
and bc horizontal velocity is always the x component of Vi
u can get arctan
and thats the angle
Lilllll — Today at 8:54 PM
yeah
which step were u stuck at-
Lilllll — Today at 8:55 PM
yeah and u get the vertical velocity at p from that
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 8:57 PM
i think i was getting it slowly?
but dk if i wouldve gotten the "find dy" part 
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 8:57 PM
mhmmhm
wait shit
u hv to use v^2=u^2-2as?
Lilllll — Today at 8:58 PM
yeah- u learned that right?
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 8:58 PM
yes yes
ohh cuz u need velocity
Lilllll — Today at 8:58 PM
mhm
is it sl physics
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:00 PM
yes
dont judge 👍
hl kids r already doing friction and tension stuff i cant
i look at that and get migraines
Lilllll — Today at 9:01 PM
lmao dw our physcis course is much slower
we r still doing velocity time graph
and the big five
lMAO
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:01 PM
LMAO-
oh welp
Lilllll — Today at 9:01 PM
oh im ok with friction and tension
yk what i rly hate
i rly rly hate all the magnetism stuff
and circuits
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:02 PM
LMFAO
we not learning abt that til next year
thank god
Lilllll — Today at 9:02 PM
LMAO LUCKY
wait r u guys gonna learn quantum mechanics in sl?
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:09 PM
hell no
what in the world
pls no
Lilllll — Today at 9:11 PM
uhh- quantum mechanics sounds rly fancy but its not THAT hard
at least in ap physics 2, cuz u cant rly dive deep into it without calc
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:12 PM
oh
dont think sl physics can wait for sl math ppl to learn calc
Lilllll — Today at 9:13 PM
ohh icic
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:13 PM
wait lily
wiat
for that question
cant u just find Vy
and do Vy-gt
to get the y velocity at what time it is
instead of getting displacement and then going back to velocity again
yeah i got 4.19m/s for that
u got 4.11
the difference is in the rounding prob
Lilllll — Today at 9:15 PM
hmm yeah ur right
ugh another braindead moment
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:16 PM
no its ok
also r u in radians for ur final answer
Lilllll — Today at 9:16 PM
oh fck yeah its in radians
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:17 PM
ok yeah i got 11.84 and urs is 11.69
we good
hopefully
Lilllll — Today at 9:17 PM
loll it should be right
and it makes sense
for the angle to be around that
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:17 PM
mhmmhm
bruh
the answer is 12.0
what
Lilllll — Today at 9:18 PM
well its 3 sig figs bro
u gotta round to 3 sig figs
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:18 PM
well 11.8
Lilllll — Today at 9:19 PM
oh we prob hv rounding errors
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:19 PM
ok nah
the answer has rounding errors
it said 23.1/2 = 11.6
breh
Lilllll — Today at 9:19 PM
oh- ok
it rounded way too early
technically we r not supposed to round anything till the last step
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:20 PM
yeah
Lilllll — Today at 9:20 PM
but im too lazy to store all teh numbers in my calculator
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:20 PM
LMAO
smh
just use the ans button
Lilllll — Today at 9:20 PM
but u needa store multiple values
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:23 PM
so take like 4 extra decimals
LMAO
sigh that was the only question i got wrong
and i didnt even get it wrong
Lilllll — Today at 9:23 PM
lmaooo is it a practice test or smth
also i just put this question in chatgpt
and guess what it gives me
ITS SO WRONG ITS ACC HILARIOUS
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:24 PM
nah just hw
chatgpt plus anything stem is just not it
Lilllll — Today at 9:25 PM
IKRRR
ok it gave me 36.2 degrees
thats so funny
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:25 PM
what the
negative gravity 💀
Lilllll — Today at 9:25 PM
this ball defies gravity basically
yeah
newton be crawling out of his grave
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:26 PM
fr
Lilllll — Today at 9:30 PM
also what does ur status mean-
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:30 PM
um
狗粮 overload
Lilllll — Today at 9:30 PM
OHH CUZ NATIONAL BF DAY
lollll
u get a lot of 狗粮 on a day?
Glad-e-8-er — Today at 9:31 PM
NO I SHOULDVE TOLD MATT CHAN TO POST
FRICK
Lilllll — Today at 9:31 PM
...
ok why would he be posting...
its not national gf day
ok wait no sry even if its national gf day he wouldnt be posting
