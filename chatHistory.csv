heyy i did not say that
isnt it 23.1
? is it?
yeah..
bruh what-
oh u meant the velocity?
ok then just sub in 23.1 wherever i use 23
LMAO k
OH
I GET IT
so basically u get the time it takes to go 15m horizontally
yeah
and then u find how high it goes in that time
and bc horizontal velocity is always the x component of Vi
u can get arctan
and thats the angle
yeah
which step were u stuck at-
yeah and u get the vertical velocity at p from that
i think i was getting it slowly?
but dk if i wouldve gotten the "find dy" part 
Glad-e-8-er â€” Today at 8:57 PM
mhmmhm
wait shit
u hv to use v^2=u^2-2as?
yeah- u learned that right?
Glad-e-8-er â€” Today at 8:58 PM
yes yes
ohh cuz u need velocity
mhm
is it sl physics
yes
dont judge
hl kids r already doing friction and tension stuff i cant
i look at that and get migraines
lmao dw our physcis course is much slower
we r still doing velocity time graph
and the big five
lMAO
LMAO-
oh welp
oh im ok with friction and tension
yk what i rly hate
i rly rly hate all the magnetism stuff
and circuits
LMFAO
we not learning abt that til next year
thank god
LMAO LUCKY
wait r u guys gonna learn quantum mechanics in sl?
hell no
what in the world
pls no
uhh- quantum mechanics sounds rly fancy but its not THAT hard
at least in ap physics 2 cuz u cant rly dive deep into it without calc
oh
dont think sl physics can wait for sl math ppl to learn calc
ohh icic
wait lily
wiat
for that question
cant u just find Vy
and do Vy-gt
to get the y velocity at what time it is
instead of getting displacement and then going back to velocity again
yeah i got 4.19m/s for that
u got 4.11
the difference is in the rounding prob
hmm yeah ur right
ugh another braindead moment
no its ok
also r u in radians for ur final answer
oh fck yeah its in radians
ok yeah i got 11.84 and urs is 11.69
we good
hopefully
loll it should be right
and it makes sense
for the angle to be around that
mhmmhm
bruh
the answer is 12.0
what
well its 3 sig figs bro
u gotta round to 3 sig figs
well 11.8
oh we prob hv rounding errors
ok nah
the answer has rounding errors
it said 23.1/2 = 11.6
breh
oh- ok
it rounded way too early
technically we r not supposed to round anything till the last step
yeah
but im too lazy to store all teh numbers in my calculator
LMAO
smh
just use the ans button
but u needa store multiple values
Glad-e-8-er â€” Today at 9:23 PM
so take like 4 extra decimals
LMAO
sigh that was the only question i got wrong
and i didnt even get it wrong
lmaooo is it a practice test or smth
also i just put this question in chatgpt
and guess what it gives me
ITS SO WRONG ITS ACC HILARIOUS
Glad-e-8-er â€” Today at 9:24 PM
nah just hw
chatgpt plus anything stem is just not it
IKRRR
ok it gave me 36.2 degrees
thats so funny
what the
negative gravity ðŸ’€
this ball defies gravity basically
yeah
newton be crawling out of his grave
fr
also what does ur status mean-
Lilllll â€” Today at 9:30 PM
OHH CUZ NATIONAL BF DAY
lollll
NO I SHOULDVE TOLD MATT CHAN TO POST
ok why would he be posting...
its not national gf day
ok wait no sry even if its national gf day he wouldnt be posting
